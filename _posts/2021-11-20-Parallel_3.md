## Performance Optimization : Work Distribution and Scheduling

Goals

- Balance **workload** onto available execution resources
- Reduce **communication** (to avoid stalls)
- Reduce extra work (**overhead**) performed to increase parallelism, manage assignment, reduce communication.

&nbsp;

### When is static assignment applicable?

- When the cost of work and the amount of work is predictable
- not all jobs have same cost, but same cost on average

### Dynamic assignment

Shared work queue : a list of work to do

- Fine granularity partitioning

workload balance가 좋지만 synchronization cost가 크다. ( 작업 한번 할 때 마다 sync )

- Coarse granularity partitioning

Synchronization cost가 감소한다. ( 적절하게 task를 잘 나눠야 한다! )

> Many tasks < - > Few tasks
>
> Many tasks : good workload but high overhead
>
> Few tasks : minimize overhead but not good workload

&nbsp;

Single work queue 를 사용할 때의 synchronization problem을 해결하기 위해 distributed queue를 사용할 수도 있다. 

When local work queue is empty, **steal** work from another work queue

&nbsp;

### Fork-join parallelism

Cilk Plus

cilk_spawn : pthread_create와 유사

cilk_sync : pthread_join과 유사

- Run continuation first ( "child stealing" )
  - Caller thread spawns work for **all iterations** before executing any of it
  - O(N) space for spawned work
- Run child first ( "continuation stealing" )
  - Caller thread only creates one item to steal
  - child stealing 방식에 비해 work queue가 작다

Cilk uses greedy join scheduling
