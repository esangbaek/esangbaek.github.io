## Fine-grained Synchronization & Lock-free Programming

Deadlock 발생 조건 (모두 만족해야 함)

- Mutual exclusion
- Hold and wait
- No preemption
- Circular wait

**Livelock** : a state where a system is executing many operations, but no thread is making meaningful progress. example : Operations continually abort and retry

**Starvation** : State where a system is making overall progress, but some progresses make no progress.

Usually not a permanent state

### Coarse-grain locks

장점 : easy to make correct

단점 : limits parallelism, no two critical sections can proceed in parallel

장점 : Fast, critical sections can proceed in parallel

단점 : Easy to make mistakes, tricky to ensure correctness

### Lock-free data structures

why?

- Acquiring locks is expensive
- 99% of the time un-necessary
  - Most concurrent actions don't actually share data

Non-blocking algorithms are lock-free if some thread is guaranteed to make progress
