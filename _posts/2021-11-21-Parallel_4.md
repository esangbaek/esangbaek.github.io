## Performance Optimization : Locality, Communication, and Contention

Total communication time : overhead + occupancy + network delay

Pipelined communication에서 memory bandwidth-bound execution!

&nbsp;

Arithmetic intensity = amount of computation(e.g., instructions)/amount of communication(e.g., bytes)

-> 높을수록 좋다

### Inherent communication

오른쪽의 grid가 communication cost가 더 크다

&nbsp;

- **Inherent communication** : information that fundamentally must be moved between processors to carry out the algorithm given the specified assignment
- **Artifactual communication** : all other communication

4개의 elements를 계산할 때마다 loads three lines을 해야한다.

다음과 같이 grid를 계산한다면 6개의 elements를 계산할 때마다 load two cache lines

즉, spatial locality 를 잘 활용하자!

&nbsp;

### Contention

- Flat communication
- Tree structured communication

&nbsp;

Reducing communication costs

- Reduce overhead of communication to sender/receiver
- Reduce latency of communication
- Reduce contention
- Increase communication/computation overlap
  - asynchronous communication, pipelining, multi-threading, pre-fetching, out-of-order execution
