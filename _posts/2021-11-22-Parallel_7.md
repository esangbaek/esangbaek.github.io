## Memory Consistency

x=0, y=0인 경우가 존재함!

Reordering of memory operations to different addresses

### Memory coherence vs Memory consistency

- Memory coherence : requirements for the observed bebavior of reads and writes to the same memory location
- Memory consistency : the behavior of reads and writes to different locations (as observed by other processor)

&nbsp;

### 3 classes of memory consistency models



- Sequential Consistency (SC) - MIPS, PA-RISC
- Total Store Order (TSO) - x86, SPARC
- Release Consistency (RC) - ARM, Itanium, PowerPC

&nbsp;

**Sequential Consistency**	MIPS, PA-RISC

Out-of-Order with SC : 순서가 바뀐 instruction이 들어오면 invalidation 시키고, 이전 instruction을 실행한다.

&nbsp;

**Total Store Ordering**	x86, SPARC

Reason : hiding store miss latency using write buffer

[그림2]

Allows reads to proceed in front of prior stores

- When store is issued, processor buffers store in write buffer
- Write buffering relaxes W->R ordering (W->R 규칙을 완화한다. 즉, 무시한다)

&nbsp;

**Partial Store Ordering**	ARM, PowerPC

Thread 2에서 flag = 1로 바뀌어서 loop를 빠져나와도 a 값이 0일 수 있다. ( initial state : 0 )

Reason : simplifying out-of-order execution, allow compiler optimizations

TSO, PSO에서 [그림1]의 예시가 발생할 수 있다

PSO에서 [그림 3]의 예시가 발생할 수 있다

4가지 순서를 모두 무시하면 performance가 증가한다. 하지만 synchronization문제가 발생!

Unsynchronized programs contain data races. The output of the program depends on relative speed of processors

fence (memory barrier)를 사용하면 해결 가능하지만 expensive하다.

### Summary

Motivation : obtain higher performance by allowing reordering of memory operations(SW complexity 증가)

&nbsp;

### Implementing locks

Desirable lock performance characteristics

- Low latency
  - If lock is free and no other processors are trying to acquire it, a processor should be able to acquire the lock quickly
- Low interconnect traffic
  - If all processors are trying to acquire lock at once, they should acquire the lock in succession with as little traffic as possible
- Scalability
  - Latency/ traffic should scale reasonably with number of processors
- Low storage cost
- Fairness
  - Avoid starvation or substantial unfairness
  - processors should acquire lock in the order they request access to it

**Test-and-Set lock**

- Repeated stores by multiple processors costly
- Generating a ton of useless interconnect traffic

**Test-and-test-and-set lock**

- Slightly higher latency than test-and-set in uncontended case (test과정이 2번이나 있다)
- Generates much less interconnect traffic
- Still no provisions for fairness

**Test-and-set lock with back off**

- Same uncontended latency as test-and-set, but potentially higher latency under contention
- Exponential back-off can cause severe unfairness
  - Newer requests back off for shorter intervals

**Ticker lock**

Main problem with test-and-set style locks : upon release, all waiting processors attempt to acquire lock using test-and-set

- No atomic operation needed to acquire the lock
- Only one invalidation per lock release
